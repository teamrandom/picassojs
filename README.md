# picasso.js - responsive colors
==============================

As you would expect the color gets darker when the screen gets smaller.

At the moment this is a brute force variant with iterating every resize event over all children.

And only the color is supported. Adjusting the background color would be the next step.

## Todo
 * be more efficient what the element detection is related
 * add background color support
